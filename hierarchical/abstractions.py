# Abstractions are things like spaces and zones. They are not elements but are 
# defined by elements. They are used to group elements together in ways that are meaningful 
# and speak to how people experience the building. For example, a room is a space that is defined by
# walls, floors, and ceilings. (Maybe boundary abstractions)

# Idea 1: We create boundaries out of our walls and floors -> We make spaces out of boundaries?

# Idea 2: We create spaces out of our walls and floors -> We make boundaries out of spaces?
