# Relationship Enhancement Plan

## Current State Analysis

The relationships module already includes several key relationship types:
- `Contains` / `IsPartOf` - for embedded objects like doors/windows in walls
- `PassesThrough` / `HasPassingThrough` - for objects passing through others
- `EmbeddedIn` / `Embeds` - for fully embedded objects
- `ConnectsTo` - for physical connections
- `AdjacentTo` - for neighboring objects
- `Supports` / `SupportedBy` - for structural support
- And others for components and creation relationships

## Missing Relationship Types for Building Models

Based on typical building modeling needs, we should add:

### Flow-Based Relationships
- `FlowsTo` / `FlowsFrom` - directional flow relationships for pipes, ducts, cables

### Spatial Relationships  
- `Above` / `Below` - vertical positioning
- `InFrontOf` / `Behind` - depth positioning
- `LeftOf` / `RightOf` - lateral positioning

### Building-Specific Relationships
- `ServesSpace` - for HVAC/electrical serving rooms
- `ServedBySystem` - inverse relationship
- `AccessesSpace` - for doors accessing rooms
- `ProvidesAccessTo` - inverse relationship

### Network/System Relationships
- `PartOfSystem` - for components in building systems
- `HasSystemComponent` - inverse relationship
- `DistributesTo` - for distribution networks
- `ReceivesFrom` - inverse relationship

## Implementation Plan

1. âœ… Add missing relationship classes to relationships.py
2. Update any relationship handling logic to support new types  
3. Add tests for new relationship types
4. Update documentation with examples of usage

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- Added FlowsTo/FlowsFrom directional flow relationships
- Added spatial positioning relationships (Above/Below, InFrontOf/Behind, LeftOf/RightOf)
- Added building-specific relationships (ServesSpace/ServedBySystem, AccessesSpace/ProvidesAccessTo)
- Added system relationships (PartOfSystem/HasSystemComponent, DistributesTo/ReceivesFrom)
- Verified EmbeddedIn relationship works correctly with doors in walls

### ðŸ”§ Remaining
- Add helper methods in items.py for new relationship types (optional)
- Add comprehensive tests for new relationships
- Update examples to demonstrate new relationship types

## Usage Examples

### Flow Relationships
- Pipe flows to fixture: `pipe.relationships.append(FlowsTo(source=pipe, target=fixture))`
- Water flows from main to branch: `branch.relationships.append(FlowsFrom(source=branch, target=main))`

### Spatial Relationships  
- Floor above basement: `floor.relationships.append(Above(source=floor, target=basement))`
- Window in front of wall: `window.relationships.append(InFrontOf(source=window, target=wall))`

### Building System Relationships
- HVAC serves room: `hvac_unit.relationships.append(ServesSpace(source=hvac_unit, target=room))`
- Door accesses space: `door.relationships.append(AccessesSpace(source=door, target=room))`
- Pipe part of plumbing system: `pipe.relationships.append(PartOfSystem(source=pipe, target=plumbing_system))`

### Embedded Relationships (existing)
- Door embedded in wall: `door.add_embedded_in_relationship(wall)`  # This creates both EmbeddedIn and Embeds relationships
